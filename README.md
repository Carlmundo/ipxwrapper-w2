# IPXWrapper for Worms 2 Plus
IPXWrapper by [solemnwarning](https://github.com/solemnwarning/ipxwrapper), is a wrapper library which emulates IPX support while tunneling the packets over UDP. This allows you to run legacy games and other software that require IPX without having to install the IPX driver which is unavailable as of Windows Vista/Server 2008.

A fork was made by [jonathanding](https://github.com/jonathanding/ipxwrapper) which added improvements for some VPN users.

This fork is based on the above and has been modified to work with [Worms 2 Plus](https://github.com/Carlmundo/W2-Plus). It allows users to play via LAN as well as load frontend modules via code from [FrontendKitWS](https://worms2d.info/FrontendKitWS).
